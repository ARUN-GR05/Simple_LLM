# Simple_LLM

A minimal and beginner-friendly project demonstrating how to work with a Large Language Model (LLM) using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## 📌 Overview
This project is designed to showcase:
- Basic interaction with an LLM
- Prompt construction
- Simple inference workflow inside a Jupyter notebook

It serves as a foundation for understanding LLM-based applications before moving to advanced topics like RAG, agents, or fine-tuning.
